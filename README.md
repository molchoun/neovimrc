# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my Neovim configuration files, built for a fast, efficient, and minimal coding experience. 
The backbone of this setup was derived from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and further customized to suit my workflow.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Neovim config directory:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
